In this lesson, Rob Jeffreys, Director of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services introduces the Leading on Data course. This course was created by the CSG Justice Center team with input from the Correctional Leaders Association and designed especially for Department of Corrections executive leadership teams. In this course, you’ll find short, practical lessons to either help you get started, or refine your approach, to working with data as a leader.

## Why This Matters 

In corrections, nearly everything is measured—movements, disciplinary actions, program participation, staffing levels, and more. However, data is only valuable when it is analyzed, understood, and applied effectively. By mastering data-driven decision-making, your executive team will be better equipped to: 

- Improve operational efficiency and resource allocation. 
- Enhance safety and security through evidence-based strategies. 
- Develop and track meaningful performance goals. 
- Strengthen transparency and accountability in your agency. 

By the end of this course, you will not only be able to interpret data more confidently but also use it to drive impactful changes within your department. 

Let’s get started on your journey to becoming a more data-informed leader!
